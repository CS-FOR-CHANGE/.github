## Welcome to CS FOR CHANGE

CS FOR CHANGE is a club, located at Edmonds College in Lynnwood, WA. We are aimed to share knowledge and support students who study Computer Science/Engineering. Here you'll find a collection of projects and resources to help you on your journey as you navigate the world of tech! If you're interested, join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/pCKmRnWKFe) server and come and meet some of our students or visit our [~~website~~](#) for any upcoming events. Resources are open to all students whether you're attend the college or not and many (if not all) of the projects are lisenced under MIT so feel free to use or modify any projects posted.  

### Projects:
- [TritonBot](https://github.com/CS-FOR-CHANGE/TritonBot) - Discord bot that authenticates users in the server
- [Portfolio](https://github.com/CS-FOR-CHANGE/Portfolio) - Main website for the club (Under construction!)
